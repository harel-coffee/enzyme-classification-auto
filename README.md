# ABLE: Attention Based Learning for Enzyme classification

Deep Learning model that exploits the attention mechanism to classify a given protein sequence into the seven enzyme classes or a negative class symbolizing that it is not an enzyme.

The developed deep learning models can be found in the /src folder. 

To recreate the results from the paper, the pretrained weights for the Attention Based Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (A-BiLSTM) model have been provided in the /model folder.
